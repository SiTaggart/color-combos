# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**color-combos** is a modern TypeScript npm package that calculates color contrast ratios and WCAG accessibility ratings for color combinations. It helps developers ensure their color choices meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

**Modern Features:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **ESM-first** with CommonJS fallback via dual package exports
- ðŸš€ **Built with Bun** for fast development and native TypeScript support  
- ðŸ“¦ **Tree-shakeable** - marked as side-effect free
- ðŸŽª **Node.js 18+** support with modern JavaScript features
- ðŸ”§ **Full TypeScript** support with comprehensive type definitions

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Build for production
bun run build

# Build for development (with source maps)
bun run build:dev

# Compile TypeScript declarations only
bun run compile:types

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format:fix

# Check bundle size
bun run bundlesize
```

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Use Bun's native test runner, located in `src/__tests__/`
- **Integration Tests**: Test compiled code in `test/integration/`
  - `cjs.test.js` - Tests CommonJS build (`dist/index.js`)
  - `esm.test.js` - Tests ESM build (`dist/index.mjs`)
  - `types.test.ts` - Tests TypeScript definitions
  - `node-compat.test.js` - Tests Node.js compatibility
- Run all tests: `bun run test:all` (unit â†’ build â†’ integration)
- Run specific test: `bun test --test-name-pattern="pattern"`

## Architecture

The entire library is contained in `src/index.ts` which exports a single default function `ColorCombos`. Key aspects:

1. **Input Handling**: Accepts colors as array (`['#fff', '#000']`) or object (`{ primary: '#fff' }`)
2. **Color Processing**: Uses the `color` library to parse various formats (hex, rgb, hsl, named colors)
3. **Contrast Calculation**: Computes contrast ratios between all color pairs
4. **WCAG Compliance**: Checks against AA (4.5:1), AA Large (3:1), AAA (7:1), and AAA Large (4.5:1) standards
5. **Options**: Supports `compact` mode, `threshold` filtering, and `uniq` duplicate removal

## Build Configuration

- **Bun**: Native bundler that outputs both ESM (`dist/index.mjs`) and CJS (`dist/index.js`) formats
- **TypeScript**: Targets ES2022 with strict mode enabled, using Bun's native TypeScript support
- **Bundle Size**: Must stay under 11kB (enforced by bundlesize)
- **Build Script**: Custom `build.ts` script uses Bun's build API for bundling and TypeScript for declaration files

## Release Process

- Uses semantic-release for automated versioning
- Releases from `main` branch only
- Git hooks via Husky ensure code quality before commits
